# MicroASM-
MicroASM is a low-level programming language designed to teach people about how lower level languages work with being too complex. HLASM is a higher level language that compiles into MicroASM. 

They are both built in python.


Another version of  the MicroASM interpreter is being made now, with more support for input and output, graphics, having multiple instances of microASM communicate with eachother, but it is very unstable and buggy right now.
